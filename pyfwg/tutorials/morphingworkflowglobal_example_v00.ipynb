    "# Advanced Usage: The `MorphingWorkflow` Classes\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates the advanced, step-by-step approach to morphing EPW files using the specialized `MorphingWorkflow` classes (`MorphingWorkflowGlobal` and `MorphingWorkflowEurope`).\n",
    "\n",
    "While the `morph_epw_*` functions are great for direct, one-shot tasks, the workflow classes are designed for complex projects where you need full control over **filename parsing, custom renaming, and process validation**. They enforce a safe, multi-step process that allows you to review and confirm each stage before executing the time-consuming morphing computation.\n",
