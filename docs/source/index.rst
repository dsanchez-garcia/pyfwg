Welcome to pyfwg's documentation! (Version |release|)
=======================================================

`pyfwg` is a robust Python workflow manager for the Future Weather Generator command-line tools.

This documentation provides detailed information on the library's three main interfaces, designed to cater to different levels of complexity:

*   **High-Level Functions (`morph_epw_global`, `morph_epw_europe`)**: For simple, one-shot morphing tasks where you need direct control over the tool's parameters without complex file renaming.
*   **Advanced Workflow Classes (`MorphingWorkflowGlobal`, `MorphingWorkflowEurope`)**: For complex projects requiring custom file renaming based on filename parsing, and full, step-by-step control over the validation and execution process.
*   **Parametric Iterator (`MorphingIterator`)**: The most powerful feature, designed for automating large batches of simulations defined in a Pandas DataFrame or an Excel file, making parametric analysis simple and structured.

Requirements
------------

Before using `pyfwg`, you need to have the following installed and configured:

* **Python 3.9+**
* **Java**: The ``java`` command must be accessible from your system's terminal (i.e., it must be in your system's PATH).
* **Future Weather Generator**: You must download the appropriate ``.jar`` file from the `official website <https://future-weather-generator.adai.pt/>`_.
    * The **Global Tool** (`FutureWeatherGenerator_vX.X.X.jar`) has been tested with versions **v3.0.0** and **v3.0.1**.
    * The **Europe Tool** (`FutureWeatherGenerator_Europe_vX.X.X.jar`) has been tested with version **v1.0.1**.

Acknowledgements
----------------

This library would not be possible without the foundational work of **Eug√©nio Rodrigues (University of Coimbra)**, the creator of the `Future Weather Generator tool <https://future-weather-generator.adai.pt/>`_. `pyfwg` is essentially a Python wrapper designed to automate and streamline the use of his powerful command-line application.
