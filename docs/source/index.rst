Welcome to pyfwg's documentation!
=================================

`pyfwg` is a robust, step-by-step Python workflow manager for the FutureWeatherGenerator command-line tool.

This documentation provides detailed information on the two main interfaces of the library: the simple, one-shot `morph_epw` function for direct usage, and the powerful `MorphingWorkflow` class for complex, step-by-step projects.

----------------

This library would not be possible without the foundational work of **Eug√©nio Rodrigues (University of Coimbra)**, the creator of the `FutureWeatherGenerator tool <https://future-weather-generator.adai.pt/>`_. `pyfwg` is essentially a Python wrapper designed to automate and streamline the use of his powerful command-line application.
