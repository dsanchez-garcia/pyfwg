    "# Advanced Usage: The `MorphingWorkflow` Class\n",

    "This notebook demonstrates the advanced, step-by-step approach to morphing EPW files using the `MorphingWorkflow` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the `morph_epw` function is great for direct, one-shot tasks, the `MorphingWorkflow` class is designed for complex projects where you need full control over **filename parsing, custom renaming, and process validation**. It enforces a safe, four-step process that allows you to review and confirm each stage before executing the time-consuming morphing computation."
