    "# Advanced Usage: The `MorphingWorkflow` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the advanced, step-by-step approach to morphing EPW files using the `MorphingWorkflow` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the `morph_epw` function is great for direct, one-shot tasks, the `MorphingWorkflow` class is designed for complex projects where you need full control over **filename parsing, custom renaming, and process validation**. It enforces a safe, four-step process that allows you to review and confirm each stage before executing the time-consuming morphing computation."

    "## The Four-Step Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The class is designed to be used as a state machine, guiding you through a logical sequence:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`map_categories()`**: Analyze the input filenames to extract meaningful data (like city, building type, etc.).\n",
    "2.  **`preview_rename_plan()`**: Use the extracted data to generate a \"dry run\" plan of how the final files will be named and organized.\n",
    "3.  **`set_morphing_config()`**: Define and validate all parameters for the FutureWeatherGenerator tool and the workflow itself.\n",
    "4.  **`execute_morphing()`**: Run the final computation, confident that your plan and configuration are correct."

    "## Understanding the Method Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: `map_categories` Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is for interpreting your source filenames.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `epw_files` (`List[str]`): **Required.** A list of paths to the EPW files you want to process.\n",
    "*   `input_filename_pattern` (`Optional[str]`, default: `None`): A Python regex string with **named capture groups** (e.g., `(?P<city>...)`) to extract structured data from filenames.\n",
    "*   `keyword_mapping` (`Optional[Dict]`, default: `None`): A dictionary of rules used for two purposes:\n",
    "    1.  **Normalization (with pattern):** Translates the raw values extracted by the pattern into clean, final values.\n",
    "    2.  **Keyword Search (without pattern):** Searches the entire filename for keywords to assign categories. This is ideal for irregularly named files.\n",
    "    *The innermost value can be a single string or a list of strings (e.g., `'seville': ['sevilla', 'svq']`).*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: `preview_rename_plan` Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "This method defines the structure of your output.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `final_output_dir` (`str`): **Required.** The path to the directory where your final, renamed files will be saved.\n",
    "*   `output_filename_pattern` (`str`): **Required.** A template string for the final filenames. It uses placeholders in braces `{}` that **must match the category names** you defined in `map_categories`.\n",
    "    *   **CRITICAL:** This pattern **MUST** contain the placeholders `{ssp}` and `{year}` to prevent generated files from being overwritten.\n",
    "    *   *Example:* `'{city}_{uhi_type}_{ssp}_{year}'`\n",
    "*   `scenario_mapping` (`Optional[Dict]`, default: `None`): A dictionary to translate raw scenario names (e.g., `'ssp126'`) into a descriptive format (e.g., `'SSP1-2.6'`) for the `{ssp}` placeholder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: `set_morphing_config` Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "This method configures the execution itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `fwg_jar_path` (`str`): **Required.** The path to the `FutureWeatherGenerator_v3.0.0.jar` file.\n",
    "*   `run_incomplete_files` (`bool`, default: `False`): If `True`, the workflow will also process files that were only partially categorized.\n",
    "*   `delete_temp_files` (`bool`, default: `True`): If `True`, temporary folders are deleted after processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note for users of `morph_epw`:** The `fwg_show_tool_output` argument and all other `fwg_` arguments (e.g., `fwg_gcms`, `fwg_interpolation_method_id`, etc.) are identical to the ones in the `morph_epw` function. They allow you to control the FutureWeatherGenerator tool with the same level of detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: `execute_morphing` Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "This method takes **no arguments**. It is the final \"Go\" button that runs the process using the configuration you have already set."
